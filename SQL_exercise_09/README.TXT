The .CSV file attached is the log file of R package downloads. Each row corresponds to one downloading. The useful information include date, time, package, the country from which the download occurred (The data is from cran-logs.rstudio.com).

You can import the .CSV file into database with the feature like "Table Data Import Wizard" in MySQL (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-admin-export-import-table.html).
